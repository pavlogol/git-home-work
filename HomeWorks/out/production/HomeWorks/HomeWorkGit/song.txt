Wake up!(Wake up!..)
Grab a brush and put a little (makeup!..),
Hide the scars to fade away the (shakeup!..)
(Hide the scars to fade away the shakeup!..)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?

Why'd you leave the keys upon the table,

In, my, self righteous suicide,
I, cry, when angels deserve to die, Die,
